## The Problem
One of the challenges in computer vision is analyzing the patterns in computer images.  It is known that computer vision and it's analysis involves **pattern recognition** - discovering patterns given specific **features** or **descriptors** of an image.  The main **objective** of this program is to cleanly recognize the line patterns given a set of **euclidean** data points - ranging from 6 data points to 10000.

**Figure 1:**  _Demonstrates the function of the program.  Through analyzing a set of euclidean data points, line segments are formed given that a set of three or more points are collinear._
